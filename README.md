Airline Reservation Systems (ARS) - manage airline seat inventory, schedules, fares, reservations, and ticket records, for travel agencies and consumer bookings.

- ARS contains key information on flight schedules, fares, passenger reservations (PNRs), and ticket issuance.
- These systems are part of Passenger Service Systems (PSS), supporting direct communication with passengers.
- Computer Reservation Systems (CRS) manage bookings for individual airlines and interface with Global Distribution Systems (GDS).
- GDS helps travel agencies and other channels make reservations for multiple airlines via a single system.
- ARS integrates airline schedules, fare tariffs, reservation records, and ticket details.
- Direct distribution channels work within an airline's reservation system and push data to the GDS.
- Consumers can book directly through the airline’s website or mobile apps.
- Indirect distribution channels like travel agencies use the same GDS, connected via SITA’s High-Level Network (HLN) for standardized messaging.
